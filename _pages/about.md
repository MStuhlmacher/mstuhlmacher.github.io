I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and GIS at DePaul University in Chicago. My research employs satellite imagery to measure green space and its social and environmental impacts on urban systems. Satellite and aerial imagery provide a view from above on the current and historic distributions of green spaceâ€”essential information for designing more equitable and sustainable cities.
