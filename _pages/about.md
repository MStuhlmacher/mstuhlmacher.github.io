I'm an Assistant Professor in the Geography Department at DePaul University in Chicago. My research employs satellite imagery to measure green space and its social and environmental impacts on urban systems. Satellite and aerial imagery provide a view from above on the current and historic distributions of green space--essential information for designing more equitable and sustainable cities.

## Ongoing Projects
__Global Urban Structure__ research project employs satellite imagery and other spatial data sources to examine the distribution of built and green spaces in cities. [Read more.](https://mstuhlmacher.github.io//projects/)

__Green Space Equity & Impacts__ project quantitatively examines local socio-ecological impacts of green space distribution, such as green gentrification. [Read more.]([https://mstuhlmacher.github.io/projects](https://mstuhlmacher.github.io//projects/))

__Community-Engaged Environmental Justice & Data Access__ research projects. An important facet of my local green space research is working with the local community to guide research design and ensure access to data and research results. [Read more.](https://mstuhlmacher.github.io//projects/)
