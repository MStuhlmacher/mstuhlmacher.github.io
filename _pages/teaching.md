## Project-Based Service Learning GIS Courses
Supported by the [Steans Center](https://resources.depaul.edu/steans-center-community-based-service-learning/Pages/default.aspx), project-based service-learning courses are a core part of DePaul University’s GIS curriculum. Students work with community organizations around Chicago and beyond to leverage their GIS skills to answer questions or create products that will help the organizations advance their mission. Students love the opportunity to apply their skills and work on-real world projects:

* *“This course gave me a better understanding of some of the issues and projects that can be solved/investigated through GIS and what is like to work with community partners to solve those problems”* (GEO 242 student, AQ21).

* *“Checking in with our organization representative and continuously shaping the product to their needs gave the experience and understanding I was hoping to gain”* (GEO 242 student, WQ 21).

### Past Partnerships
Below are our partnerships and resulting reports to date. GEO 242 is the undergraduate level version of the course and GEO 442 is the graduate level. Are you a Chicago-based community organization with a GIS project or question you’d like an answer to? We’re always looking for projects, so please email me or the Steans Center.
