## Project-Based Service Learning GIS Courses
Supported by the [Steans Center](https://resources.depaul.edu/steans-center-community-based-service-learning/Pages/default.aspx), project-based service-learning courses are a core part of DePaul University’s GIS curriculum. Students work with community organizations around Chicago and beyond to leverage their GIS skills to answer questions or create products that will help the organizations advance their mission. Students enjoy and are motivated by the opportunity to apply their skills and work on real-world projects:

* *“This course gave me a better understanding of some of the issues and projects that can be solved/investigated through GIS and what is like to work with community partners to solve those problems”* (GEO 242 student, AQ21).

* *“I really enjoyed the service–learning design, and it motivated me and my group to 'up our game' to help the Pilsen community. It was also good to be able to put the skills and tools we have learned to use in a real life environment.”* (GEO 442 student, WQ22).

* *“The most meaningful aspect [...] was working towards a common goal with my team and with our non-profit partner. My key insight is that having group members with different professional backgrounds helps bring diverse perspectives to a project and helps develop a more creative project.”* (GEO 442 student, SQ24).

## Past Partnerships
Below are our partnerships and resulting reports to date. GEO 242 is the undergraduate level version of the course and GEO 442 is the graduate level. Are you a Chicago-based community organization with a GIS project or question you’d like an answer to? We’re always looking for projects, so please email me or the Steans Center.
