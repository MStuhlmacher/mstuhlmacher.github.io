## Global Urban Structure 
This research project employs satellite imagery and other spatial data sources to examine the distribution of built and green spaces in cities. We explored the change in the urban built footprint of 150 cities in the United States, India, and China between 1995-2015 and found that as cities grow, they often increase in complexity and compactness contributing to stronger daytime surface urban heat island intensities.<sup>1</sup> This research also evaluated whether the global cities in our analysis show similar growth patterns (i.e., homogenization) which could correspond with similar urban heat island consequences as cities grow.

Looking at urban green space, we recently completed research (under review) examining the scaling relationships between city size and green space availability. We found that urban green space follows a pervasive sublinear scaling relationship with city size. This scaling indicates that green space declines in per-unit access as cities grow larger. More research is planned in this space in terms of green space distribution (i.e., composition and configuration) and the differential consequences on urban communities.

## Green Space Equity & Impacts
This project quantitatively examines local socio-ecological impacts of green space distribution, such as green gentrification. We modeled the influence of park and non-park green space on gentrification in Chicago and found that neighborhood characteristics—like the proximity to downtown or whether neighboring areas were gentrifying—were better predictors of gentrification than green space investments.<sup>1</sup> We see these results as potentially good news that all green investments may not be inherently linked to gentrification, but caution is needed in areas that are already at an elevated risk for gentrification.

## Community-Engaged Environmental Justice   & Data Access
An important facet of my local green space research is working with the local community to guide research design and ensure access to data and research results. Current collaborations include green gentrification research in Pilsen. Pilsen, a predominately Mexican-American neighborhood in Chicago, is underserved by green space and overburdened by historic and current environmental toxins. There is concerned, however, that outside efforts to green Pilsen will increase the desirability of the neighborhood and trigger further gentrification and displacement. 

Collaboration with community members in Pilsen began in 2021 when Dr. Winifred Curran and I received internal funding to collect data on formal and informal green space in Pilsen. In addition to collecting and collating the data through a community engaged service-learning course, we held a workshop where community members discussed the type of green space they utilize in their neighborhood and future types of greening they are interested in.<sup>1</sup> 

In 2022, we received funding from NASA to continue this collaboration in Pilsen.<sup>2</sup> With this funding we will make social and environmental data available in an interactive, open-source dashboard (https://chichives.com/). The goal of the project is to make the data easier for the alderman and community members to access and use for green space decision making in Pilsen.<sup>3</sup>
