## Green Space Equity & Impacts
My research in this arena quantitatively examines local socio-ecological impacts of green space distribution, such as environmental justice and green gentrification. Using Chicago as a case study, we have modeled the role of informal green space<sup>1</sup> and pre-exisiting greening<sup>2</sup> on whether a neighborhood gentrifies. 

I'm also part of an interdisciplinary project investigating the impact of public spaces on cognition, emotion, and well-being for Black, Latinx, and White urban residents.<sup>3,4,5</sup> If you would like to be involved with this project as a community partner or research participant, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMNs8w5LM1QnEz6ZbgpYuCWujBv5TfWHvewqj-i67LsMBa4A/viewform?pli=1).

## Community-Engaged Environmental Justice & Data Access
My green space research is shaped by community collaborations that inform research design and prioritizes data sharing. In 2022, we received a grant from NASA to expand on a previous service-learning partnership with Pilsen.<sup>2</sup> With this funding, we have build an interactive, open-source dashboard ([ChiVes](https://chichives.com/)) for social and environmental data. The goal of the project is to make the data easier for the alderman and community members to access and use for green space decision making in Pilsen and around Chicago.<sup>3,4</sup>

## Global Urban Form
This research domain employs satellite imagery and other spatial data sources to examine the distribution of the built footprint and green spaces in cities. We found that as cities grow, they often increase in complexity and compactness contributing to stronger daytime surface urban heat island intensities.<sup>1</sup> This research also evaluated whether the global cities in our analysis show similar growth patterns (i.e., homogenization) which could correspond with similar urban heat island consequences as cities grow.
