# Green Space Equity & Impacts
My main research area examines the distribution of urban green space and resulting socio-ecological impacts. Projects and recent publications from this research include:
* Examining the unequal distribution of park and tree canopy area and connectivity in ten U.S. cities. We found that green space inequality goes beyond the total amount of green space. Across the ten cities, White, wealthy, and highly educated neighborhoods had more connected green space.<sup>1</sup>
* Utilizing cell phone mobility data to examine local park access and the drivers behind park visitation. We found that, all else equal, wealthier communities visit local parks more frequently but the presence of water in a park increased local visits significantly for all nearby residents.<sup>2</sup>
* A NSF-funded interdisciplinary project investigating the impact of public spaces on cognition, emotion, and well-being for urban residents of a variety of socio-economic and racial backgrounds.<sup>3,4,5</sup> If you would like to be involved with this project as a community partner or research participant, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMNs8w5LM1QnEz6ZbgpYuCWujBv5TfWHvewqj-i67LsMBa4A/viewform?pli=1).

# Green Gentrification
My research on green gentrification complements the urban green space equity research described above because an understanding of green gentrification is vital to improving green space equity in cities without displacement.<sup>4</sup> Projects and recent publications in this space include:
* A multi-institutional collaboration that quantitatively and qualitatively examines the “green gentrification cycle” (the hypothesis that gentrification may both precede and follow greening). This team has recently published an article that utilizes hedonic models to examine how housing costs changed before and after new parks opened in Chicago and Los Angeles.<sup>1</sup>
* Examinations of greening and gentrification pathways in Chicago.<sup>2</sup> In recent research, we examine where and under what conditions green investments do (and do not) led to gentrification. We found that a large new park alone was not linked to gentrification, but it was when located in areas with nearby gentrification and lacking both preexisting green space and government-assisted public housing. Additionally, a large new park in areas that already had adequate green space per resident did not spur gentrification, even if the area had a lower level of public housing.<sup>3</sup>

# Community-Engaged Environmental Justice & Data Access
This project aims to put environmental data from satellites in the hands of communities experiencing environmental injustice.<sup>1</sup>  In collaboration with the Health Regions and Policy Lab at UIUC and our community partners we have launched ([ChiVes](https://chichives.com/)), an interactive data visualization dashboard and worked with our community partners to 1) identify data to include, 2) improve dashboard usability, and 3) train the community on how to use the tool. Since launch, ChiVes has had 6,442 unique visits, we’ve tabled at three community events, and have held six workshops and focus groups. The grant closes in September 2024, but along the way we have been sharing results and lessons learned in publications and presentations.<sup>2,3,4</sup>
