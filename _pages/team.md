Research, teaching, and learning happens through collaboration large and small. I love bringing my research into my teaching and my students into my research.

## Looking for research experience?
If youâ€™re a current student at DePaul University interested in getting involved in research, please reach out. I generally ask that research assistants have completed GEO 343/443 (Earth Observation II), but relevant coursework varies by research topic. Below are some of the ways students can get paid or earn course credit for getting involved in research on campus.
### Funding sources for student research at DePaul:
#### 1. Summer Undergraduate Research Grant (SURG)
The SURG program is student-driven where the student proposes the research topic and partners with a faculty member to complete the research project over the summer. [Learn more here.](https://las.depaul.edu/student-resources/undergraduate-research/Pages/grant-programs.aspx) 

#### 2. Undergraduate Research Assistant Program (URAP)
The URAP programs provides funding for faculty to hire undergraduate students to collaborate with faculty on their research projects. There are two cycles every academic year, summer/fall and winter/spring. [Learn more here.](https://las.depaul.edu/faculty-and-staff/faculty-grants-fellowships/Pages/grant-programs.aspx) 

#### 3. Grant-based Research Assistant Positions
I also hire students to contribute to research projects funded by research grants. These positions vary, but are always posted on the GEO listserv. Keep an eye out there.
